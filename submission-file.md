## Introduction to Application

CoffeeMe is a coffee app based on iOS for personal use. I am a daily coffee drinker, and my greatest joy is to try all the coffee from the coffee shops around me. This app offers nearby coffee shops and different types of coffee with flavors and prices. 

### Features
* üì± **HomePage (P1 & P2)**     

Recommended coffee and nearby coffee shops (you can swipe to select!) 

* üòÉ **Account (P3)**  

This page contains the personal information. 

* ‚òïÔ∏è **Coffee Detail Pages (P4 & P5 & P6)**

1. Shows the description and price of each coffee. (The images and details of the different coffees I used are from Pret A Manger and Starbucks.)
2. Click on the red heart in the top right corner to add to favourite.
3. Clicking on 'order now' will bring up a pop-up reminder.

* üåá **Coffee Shop Detail Pages (P7 & P8)**    

Shows several cafes near my home, each of the different shop corresponds to their own picture, description and rating.
